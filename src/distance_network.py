This file uses the line intersections (output from line_intersections), closest points to units on lines (output from lines_households_matching) and closest points to transformers (lines_transformers_matching) to create a networkx Graph with edges between points on same line. These edges have the respective distance as their weight. Then find shortest path between a point with a household id and point with transformer id using Dijkstra alogrithm.
